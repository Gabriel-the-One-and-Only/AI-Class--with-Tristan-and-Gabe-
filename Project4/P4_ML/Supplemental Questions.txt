Section 1 Question:
	The number of hidden layers was chosen to be two because we thought of how we would identify
handwritten numbers ourselves and decided on needing at least 2. number of nodes and batch size were
found through fiddling around with the values to find the fastest computing combination. for the 
learning rate we decided on a variable rate that would be large initially but get smaller as batches
progressed in order to have the benefits of both a fast and slow learning rate.

Section 2 Questions:
	The intersection over union (IoU) opperation is designed to output a score from 0 to 1 on how
close two bounding boxes are to being the same. The way IoU does this is by taking the area of the 
boxes' intersection and dividing it by the area of the boxes union. This is used in non-max supression 
to find the bounding box that has the best chance of accurately representing the object its surrounding.

	The purpose of non-max suppression is to reduce the number of boxes around the same object. For 
example, 3 seperate bounding boxes could all be on the same object, so non-max supression uses the 
intersection over union opperation to get scores on how close each box is to being the other boxes.
Non-max suppression would then keep the box that was most like the other two and delete the others.
