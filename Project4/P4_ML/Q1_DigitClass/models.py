class DigitClassificationModel(object):
    """
    A model for handwritten digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

    Each handwritten digit is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, which is flattened
    into a 784-dimensional vector for the purposes of this model. Each entry in
    the vector is a floating point number between 0 and 1.

    The goal is to sort each digit into one of 10 classes (number 0 through 9).

    (See RegressionModel for more information about the APIs of different
    methods here. We recommend that you implement the RegressionModel before
    working on this part of the project.)
