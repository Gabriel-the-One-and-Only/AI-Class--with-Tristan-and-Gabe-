There is a small problem with our q4 and the exact inference is slightly off. 
Looking at the small squared norm will confirm this.

Parts 2 and 3 of the Q3 test we had noticed a difference emerging in the coloration of the squares
with the bottom squares having a higher chance. This is most likely due to the Ghost using the 
GoSouthWest move distribution, and because of pacman knowing this the shading of the squares
favored the south portion of the boards just like the ghost did.

Updating with the elapsed time allows knowledge of where the ghosts could possibly be 
move after move and this gives direction information to pacman. Whereas the manhattan distance alone
cannot always reduce to a singular direction. Therefore pacman is more often not heading for a hotspot
with no ghost.
