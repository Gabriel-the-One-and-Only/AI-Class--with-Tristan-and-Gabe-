There is a small problem with our q4 and the exact inference is slightly off. 
Looking at the small squared norm will confirm this.

3-1
The manhattan distance will 

10-1
Updating with the elapsed time allows knowledge of where the ghosts could possibly be 
move after move and this gives direction information to pacman. Whereas the manhattan distance alone
cannot always reduce to a singular direction. Therefore pacman is more often not heading for a hotspot
with no ghost.
